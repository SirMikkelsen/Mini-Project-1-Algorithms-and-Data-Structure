# Mini-Project-1-Algorithms-and-Data-Structure

We have the following algorithms where the Shakespeare text take the specified amount of time to run.

* Heap sort: 11,16 seconds
* Merge sort: 5,04 seconds

We have attempted to implement the rest of the sorting algorithms, and feel we are really close, but we have spent a large amount of time dealing with some errors we unfortunately couldn't resolve.
